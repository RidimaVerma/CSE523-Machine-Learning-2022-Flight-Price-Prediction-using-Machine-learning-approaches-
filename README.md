# CSE523-Machine-Learning-2022-Flight-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-learning-approaches- Flight Fare Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the fare of a flight based on various factors such as the source, destination, departure time, and airline.

Folder Structure:

Code: Contains all the source code files for the project.
Presentations: Contains the mid-semester and end-semester presentations made during the project.
Data Set: Contains the data set used for training and testing the machine learning model.
Report: Contains the weekly, mid-semester, and end-semester reports generated during the project.
Results: Contains the final results of the machine learning model.
Requirements:

Python 3.7 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib

Instructions:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install all the dependencies mentioned in the "Requirements" section.
Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the "Code" folder.
Run the "code" file to preprocess the data set, to select the relevant features for training the model and to train the machine learning model.
The final results of the model will be stored in the "Results" folder.
